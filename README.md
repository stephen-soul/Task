# Task
![alt text](https://stephenfetinko.com/img/task.png)

A to-do list made in Qt Creator for Windows and Linux.

## What is this for?
Have you ever had some sort of challenge and think, "I could really use a better way to track things?" ... Pen and paper is always an option, but then you're forced to deal with hand cramps (at least if you're me). And that's no fun, so I made an application in QT to act like a task list that lets you...

1. Add tasks to the list.
2. Remove tasks from the list.
3. Name your project.
4. Track your score (added tasks increment the total score, completed tasks add to your score).
5. Save your project.
6. Load your project.

A brief example is this: 
You have a project where you need to output helloworld in Java. IDE's are pretty good at doing this on their own, but whatever. Let's say this is your checklist.

1. Start new project
2. Write 'System.Out.Println("Hello World");' in main

Alright. So we started our new project, and we click on the first item in the list. Now our checklist looks like this:

1. ~~Start new project~~
2. Write 'System.Out.Println("Hello World");' in main

And there you go.


## Installation
"Alright, neat. What do I do to download it?" I hear you ask. You will need QT downloaded from QT's website [here](https://www.qt.io/download). I'm waiting on confirmation on if it's really needed for Linux or Windows or both. But for the time being if you are on Windows then you can download the link [here](https://stephenfetinko.com/Task.7z). It's hosted on my website stephenfetinko.com if you don't trust random links. Then just extract and double click checklist.exe (the old name of the project). If you're on Linux there's an older app image (instructions are on the page on my website - basically download, chmod a+x and ./Task-x86_64.AppImage or handle it through right click and the GUI). But for either, if you have QT, you can always download the source and run it from QT Creator.

## Have some feedback for me?
If you have any feedback please either make an issue or feel free to send me an email at sfetinko@gmail.com ... Is that still a common practice? Either way, I'm always up to learn more.
